        Triggers the execution of a pipeline asynchronously and streams back the response.
        This method is intended for real-time inference when low latency is of concern
        and the response needs to be processed incrementally.

        The pipeline is identified by its resource name, formed by the parent namespace
        and ID of the pipeline.

      changes are expected. Before reaching general availability, it should be
      validated by a broader group of users. Some fixes might be added during
      this process.

      The `version` field in the definition must have `beta` as its first
      pre-release identifier, e.g., `0.1.0-beta`, `0.1.3-beta.1`.

  protobufAny:
    type: object

        type: string
        description: |-
          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
          the fully qualified name of the type (as in
          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
            value in binary format, or produce an error.
          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
            breaking changes.)

          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
          type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type server
          implementations and no plans to implement one.

          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
          used with implementation specific semantics.

      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
      URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any;
          any.PackFrom(foo);
          ...
          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
            ...
          }

      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
          ...
          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
          }
          // or ...
          if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
          }

       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          foo = Foo(...)
          any = Any()
          any.Pack(foo)
          ...
          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
            any.Unpack(foo)
            ...

       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
           any, err := anypb.New(foo)
           if err != nil {
             ...
           }
           ...
           foo := &pb.Foo{}
           if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
             ...
           }

      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
      name "y.z".

      JSON
      ====
      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

          package google.profile;
          message Person {
            string first_name = 1;
            string last_name = 2;
          }

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
            "firstName": <string>,
            "lastName": <string>
          }

      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
            "value": "1.212s"
          }
