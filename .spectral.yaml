  # [`grpc-gateway` issue 3058](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/issues/3058):
  # Most tooling ignores keywords next to `$ref`. However, `grpc-gateway`
  # produces such keywords.

  # `grpc-gateway` generates types for nested types, but sometimes these are
  # only used by requests (e.g. `ComponentDefinition.View`). Request structures
  # are defined as part of the endpoint definition, so these nested types end
  # up defined but not referenced.

  # `grpc-gateway` generates path parameters that don't match OpenAPI spec
  # requirements when using AIP-134 style update operations (PATCH with nested
  # field names like `{resource.name=pattern}`) and when multiple endpoints
  # resolve to similar path patterns. This is a known limitation:
  # - PATCH operations generate mismatched parameter names (e.g., `knowledgeBase.name`)
  # - Multiple GET/DELETE endpoints create equivalent paths like `/v1alpha/{name_1}`
  # See: https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/issues/2578
